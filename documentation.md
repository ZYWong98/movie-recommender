* Model Design and implementation and training

* This project involves building a content-based filtering recommendation system for movies, specifically designed to recommend movies to users based on the similarity of movie descriptions (overviews) to a user’s preferences. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) and cosine similarity to analyze and compare movie descriptions, allowing us to recommend movies with similar themes, genres, or content.

* Importance of Each Step

	1.	Dataset Preparation:
		* Final Row Addition: A new row is added to the dataset with the type of movies the user is interested in, fully populated and preprocessed to align with the rest of the dataset. This row represents the user’s preferences and serves as a reference point for recommendations.
		* Importance: Adding this row allows us to use the user’s preferences as a basis for identifying similar movies, ensuring that recommendations are tailored to the user’s tastes.
	2.	Text Preprocessing and Vectorization:
	•	TFIDFVectorizer (Scikit-Learn): The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorizer is applied to the overview column of the dataset to transform text data into numerical vectors based on word relevance.
	•	Importance: This step quantifies each movie’s overview, converting descriptions into vectorized forms that can be mathematically compared for similarity. It’s essential for generating accurate recommendations based on textual content.
	3.	Cosine Similarity Calculation:
	•	linear_kernel(): Using the linear kernel function, we compute cosine similarity scores between movies based on their TF-IDF vectors, highlighting similarities in the descriptions.
	•	Importance: Cosine similarity enables us to measure how closely related each movie’s content is to the user’s preferences, forming the core of our content-based filtering system.
	4.	Index Mapping:
	•	Reverse Indexing: A reverse index is created to map movie titles to their respective indices in the dataset.
	•	Importance: This allows efficient look-up of a movie’s index by title, making it easy to retrieve specific movie data and improve system usability.
	5.	Recommendation Function:
	•	Steps in Function:
  	•	Retrieve the index of the user’s preferred movie.
  	•	Calculate similarity scores for all other movies.
  	•	Sort movies by similarity score in descending order.
	•	Filter and return the top 10 movies.

	•	Importance: This function performs the recommendation process, ranking movies based on relevance to the user’s preferences and returning the best matches, which is the final goal of the project.
