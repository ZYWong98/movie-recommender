* Model Design and implementation and training

* This project involves building a content-based filtering recommendation system for movies, specifically designed to recommend movies to users based on the similarity of movie descriptions (overviews) to a user’s preferences. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) and cosine similarity to analyze and compare movie descriptions, allowing us to recommend movies with similar themes, genres, or content.

* Overview Recommendation

	1.	Dataset Preparation:
		* Removing Stopwords : Any remaining stopwords are removed
		* Importance: This preprocessing step standardizes the data, reducing noise and ensuring that the words in each movie’s description are represented uniformly
	2.	Text Preprocessing and Vectorization:
		* TFIDFVectorizer (Scikit-Learn): The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorizer is applied to the overview column of the dataset to transform text data into numerical vectors based on word relevance.
		* Importance: This step quantifies each movie’s overview, converting descriptions into vectorized forms that can be mathematically compared for similarity. It’s essential for generating accurate recommendations based on textual content.
	3.	Cosine Similarity Calculation:
		* linear_kernel(): Using the linear kernel function, we compute cosine similarity scores between movies based on their TF-IDF vectors, highlighting similarities in the descriptions.
		* Importance: Cosine similarity enables us to measure how closely related each movie’s content is to the user’s preferences, forming the core of our content-based filtering system.
	4.	Index Mapping:
		* Reverse Indexing: A reverse index is created to map movie titles to their respective indices in the dataset.
		* Importance: This allows efficient look-up of a movie’s index by title, making it easy to retrieve specific movie data and improve system usability.
	5.	Recommendation Function:
		* Steps in Function:
  			* Retrieve the index of the user’s preferred movie.
  			* Calculate similarity scores for all other movies.
  			* Sort movies by similarity score in descending order.
			* Filter and return the top 10 movies.

  		* Importance: This function performs the recommendation process, ranking movies based on relevance to the user’s preferences and returning the best matches, which is the final goal of the project.

* Genre & Keyword Recommendation

* Using content-based movie recommendation system that uses genre and keywords as the main features for recommending movies similar to a user’s preferences. The recommendation system utilizes cosine similarity to compare movies based on genre and thematic keywords, allowing it to recommend movies that align closely with specific user interests.


	1.	Data Cleaning:
		* Removing Stopwords & Lowercasing: Any remaining stopwords are removed, and all words are converted to lowercase to ensure consistency in text processing.
		* Importance: This preprocessing step standardizes the data, reducing noise and ensuring that the words in each movie’s description are represented uniformly, which improves the quality of recommendations.
	2.	Metadata Soup Creation:
		* Combining Genre and Keywords: The metadata soup is created by merging each movie’s genre and keywords into a single string of words.
		* Importance: This consolidated text (metadata soup) forms the basis for vectorization, allowing the system to consider both genres and key themes in movies when computing similarities.
	3.	Vectorization:
		* CountVectorizer (Scikit-Learn): CountVectorizer is applied to the metadata soup to convert it into a matrix of word counts, where each word’s frequency in the soup is represented numerically.
		* Importance: CountVectorizer enables the system to capture the thematic presence and genre of each movie in a numerical form, making it possible to compute similarities effectively.
	4.	Cosine Similarity Calculation:
		* Cosine Similarity: Using cosine similarity on the count matrix, the system calculates similarity scores between movies.
		* Importance: Cosine similarity helps identify how closely each movie’s genre and keywords align with another, establishing a strong basis for content-based filtering.
	5.	Index Mapping:
		* Reverse Indexing: Titles are mapped to indices in the dataset to enable easy retrieval of each movie by title.
		* Importance: This makes it simple to look up specific movies and retrieve recommendations efficiently.
	6.	Recommendation Function:
		* Steps in Function:
			* Retrieve the index of the selected movie.
			* Calculate similarity scores between this movie and all others.
			* Sort and filter the top 10 most similar movies based on score.
		* Importance: This function returns the top movie recommendations based on genre and keywords, achieving the project’s goal of providing tailored movie suggestions.
